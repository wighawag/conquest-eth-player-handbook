* Capacity: This is the number of planet after which the planet stop producing. Actually when the planet have more spaceships that this number, the number of spaceship starts decreasing at a rate of  1 every 2 seconds.
* Natives: This number represent the local population present on the planet before anyone claim it. When you stake on a planet you basically perform an attack of power 10,000 (see below) and a fleet of 100,000 spaceships. These fight against the native and the result is what you get on the planet after staing.
* Stake: It is amount of token you need to deposit to make the planet produce spaceship for you. If the planet has natives, you ll fight them. If the planet is empty or you already control it, you ll get 100,000 spaceships more
* Production: the amount of spaceships the planet produce per hours when a stake is deposited on it
* Attack: the attack power that is associated with every fleet sent from this planet
* Defense: the defense power that protect that planet from any enemies fleet
* Speed: the Speed of the fleets sent from this planet. It act as a multiplier.&#x20;
*   Upkeep: This value increase when spaceships are sent away from this planet (unless the planet was at over capacity and sending did not result in the planet starting to produce more)

    It increase when max capacity is reached

    When it is positive, it decrease but cut in half the production of the planet until upkeep reaches zero

    When a fleet originating from the planet is destroyed as a result of an attack, upkeep is refunded.&#x20;
