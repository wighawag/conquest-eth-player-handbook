# Combining Attacks

In conquest, advantages is given to the bigger number, see [combat](../fundamentals/combat.md)

And while you can (And sometime should) combine fleets on to an intermediary planet before sending your attack to an enemy, you can also combine them at the destination.

To do so, you just need to ensure they arrive at the same time at the same destination planet.

You can do so via the UI by selecting a current traveling fleet. Note that your new fleet will need to be at a distance short enough to be able to arrive at that time. You'll also need to consider potential delay due to tx inclusion. The UI take care of some of that delay by adding an offset to catter for such time delay, but it cannot predict 100%.
