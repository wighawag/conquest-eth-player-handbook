# Exit a planet

While it is fun to attack others :smile: you might want to take back the stake that you recently captured. Or you might also want to take the stake of your original planets to reinvest in other or take it back to your wallet.

In conquest.eth your only option to take the stake back, is to "exit" a planet. This process take times. 3 days in the current game settings. You simply select your planet and click "exit"

And your planet will now have a red circle forming:

Once the circle is full, you ll be able to withdraw your token, see [Withdraw](withdraw.md)
