# Resolving Manually

If you decide to not use the [Agent Service](agent-service.md) you ll have to resolve your fleet manually. It can also happen that the agent-service fails to resolve and you ll then need to resolve fleets manually here too.

Here we will show you how to resolve manually

You will see the following on the top right corner of the screen.&#x20;

You can resolve them each individually

Once all is done, the list will be empty

{% hint style="info" %}
If the agent-service was supposed to resolve a fleet, you ll have to wait 5 minute before the red rectangle show up and it might be that when the 5 minute pass, the fleet would be resolved already anyway by the agent-service
