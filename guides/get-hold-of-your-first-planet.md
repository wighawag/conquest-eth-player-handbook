In conquest, without planet you cannot do anything.

In order to start playing, you will have to chose a planet in the universe that no one have claimed yet.&#x20;

Not every planets in the universe are available from the get go though. In the image above, there is dashed rectangle that indicate the zone in which you are allowed to claim a planet. This area expands as planets get claimed near its border.

To claim a planet, you just click "Stake" and a popup comes up asking you to confirm the amount of token you ll have to deposit on the planet.

{% hint style="info" %}
The token you deposit are not spent. They remains on the planet until you exit the planet. And note that exiting takes time (3 days with the current game settings). This means someone who manage to attack you successfully can get hold of your token. And you can do the same to others.
