# Send your first fleet

Once you have a planet, you ll get some spaceships that you can then send away. Actually your planet will continuously produce spaceships until it reaches its max capacity.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that you can always send more spaceship to a planet that is at max capacity but note that these spaceships will continue to decrease to reach to the max cap.
{% endhint %}

Your spaceships act both as defence for your planet and as attack power. This means that when you send a fleet to attack other, you are also reducing your defence

To Send spaceship you have to select your destination first and click "Send Here"

After which you ll be asked to provide the origin (note that the target planet ha sow a circle around it and its information is shown on the right-end side:

Upon clicking "confirm" (on the right-end side info panel) you ll be presented with some helper text. In particular it will inform you that sending spaceships is a process that involves 2 transactions. The first one will make the spaceship start moving and the second will need to be performed once the fleet arrive at the destination. If you do not resolve after 12 hours later, the fleet is lost forever.

{% hint style="info" %}
While the fleet travel only you knows where it is going.
{% endhint %}

Obviously, the arrival time might be inconvenient for you and for that reason we provide a service, the "agent service" that will perform the transaction for you. See [Agent Service](agent-service.md)

Once you confirm this information, you'll see the following:

This screen will let you decide how many spaceship you want your fleet to depart with. If the destination is another player with which you have no alliance, it will by default send an attacking fleet. But you can chose to instead send friendly spaceships by sectioning the "give" tab

Unless you and the destination are in an alliance, the sending of friendly spaceship incurs a 20% burn tax: only 80% of your spaceships will actually be given.

Once you click confirm, you ll be reminded of the importance of the second transaction:

And finally you ll have to confirm with your wallet:

Once approved, you ll see a confirmation message that let you add the an event on your calendar

And you will see your fleet on its way on the map:

You can always inspect your fleets by clicking on them (or zooming in):
